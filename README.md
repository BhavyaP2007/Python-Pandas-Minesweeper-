# Python-Pandas-Minesweeper-
Overview
This project is a Python-based Minesweeper grid generator using the Pandas library. It allows users to create a customizable Minesweeper grid by specifying the dimensions (rows and columns) of the grid. The grid is generated with a random distribution of mines, and the surrounding numbers indicate how many mines are adjacent to each cell.
This project is a fun and interactive way to understand the logic behind the classic Minesweeper game while leveraging Python's Pandas library for data manipulation and grid representation.

What is Minesweeper?
Minesweeper is a single-player puzzle video game. The objective of the game is to clear a rectangular board containing hidden "mines" or bombs without detonating any of them. The game provides numerical clues that indicate how many mines are adjacent to a particular cell. Using these clues, the player must deduce which cells are safe to click and which cells contain mines.

Dependencies :
pip install pandas
pip install numpy
